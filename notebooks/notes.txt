1. Precision (Fraud Detection Accuracy)
ðŸ”¹ Definition: Precision measures how many of the transactions predicted as fraud were actually fraud.
ðŸ”¹ Interpretation:
High precision means fewer false alarms (legitimate transactions wrongly flagged as fraud).
If precision is low, too many normal transactions are being wrongly flagged, leading to frustrated customers.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
The model predicts 100 transactions as fraud, but only 30 are actually fraud â†’ Precision = 30/100 = 0.30 (30%).
Low precision â†’ Many false positives (FP), leading to inconvenience for genuine users.


2. Recall (Fraud Catch Rate) â€“ Most Critical
ðŸ”¹ Definition: Recall measures how many actual frauds were correctly detected.
ðŸ”¹ Interpretation:
High recall means very few fraud cases are missed.
If recall is low, fraudsters escape detection, causing financial loss.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
There are 100 actual frauds, but the model detects only 30 â†’ Recall = 30/100 = 0.30 (30%).
Low recall â†’ Many fraudulent transactions go undetected (false negatives).

âš  Why recall is crucial?
Missing a fraudulent transaction (false negative) means the fraudster gets away!
A recall of 90%+ is often preferred in fraud detection.


3. F1-score (Balance Between Precision & Recall)
ðŸ”¹ Definition: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

ðŸ”¹ Interpretation:
- If precision is too high, recall may be too low (many frauds missed).
- If recall is too high, precision may be too low (too many false alarms).
- F1-score finds the best trade-off to balance both.
- Higher F1-score means a better fraud detection balance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If False Positives (FP) are costly â†’ Precision

- Example: If blocking a legitimate transaction causes frustration for users, you want high precision (fewer false positives).

2. If False Negatives (FN) are costly â†’ Recall

- Example: If missing a fraudulent transaction leads to financial losses, then high recall is better (catching most fraud cases).

3. If Both False Positives & False Negatives Matter â†’ F1-score

Since we have a balanced dataset, F1-score is ideal because it balances precision & recall.


Final Recommendation :
âœ… Use F1-score if you want a balanced fraud detection model
âœ… Use Recall if catching all fraud cases is more important
âœ… Use Precision if reducing false alarms is more important

We will focus on high F1-score as we want a balanced fraud detection model
Therefore, We will be Moving ahead with Logistic Regression and Power Transformer
